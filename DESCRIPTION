Description: Due to human error, the process of manually creating APA (i.e.,
    American Psychological Association style) style tables is prone to transcription
    errors. Additionally, in R a large number of function calls are often needed to
    obtain all of the desired information for a single APA style table. This package
    creates PDF files (.pdf files) containing APA style tables for several types
    of analyses via LaTeX. Using this package minimizes transcription errors and
    reduces the number commands needed by the user. Currently, the following tables
    can be created: Correlation tables - Correlation tables are created from data
    frames using CorTable
